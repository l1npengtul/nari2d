# NariScript Types

Types:
- `Float`: Floating Point Numbers, 64 bit.
- `Int`: Integer, 64 bit
- `Str`: A UTF-8 encoded string.
- `Array`: A heterogenous growable array.
- `Map`: A key-value store.
- `Function`: Functions.

NariScript is **statically typed**. This means that the types are checked at compile-time.
